# Contribution Guide

Hi future contributor, I know that this guide could hear harsh, but understand me, this project
don't want to become something fully usable, rather that that the main focus is to provide a path
in which someone could easily understand _how to develop an operative system/kernel?_ or even
_how to code in bare metal?_ and other questions that everyone could have.


## How to code

Well as I don't know (now) if this project will have a coding standard tools I've been grateful
if you propose that or guide with the style that is on the code.

## Messages of the contributions

Sometimes the titles could be self explanatory but I'd be grateful if you can provide a description
on your PR that explain your POV of the solution, fix, etc. and why, how and what. This is not
a rule, but If you can help with that I think that this project will be better.

## Interaction

If this project comes to have a discussion thread I'd be fascinated, but I think that always
there is a must to be polite on all of the message, if I see something that could be bad for
someone I'll remove that PR, comment or whatever else.

## Have fun

The only must on each contribution is that you need to have fun on whatever do you do, there is
no need to be something so optimized but have fun while developing, remember this is a hobby and
educational project.
