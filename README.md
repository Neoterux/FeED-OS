# FeEdOS

A project focused on learning mostly all of the operative system development, a lot of the things
that will be developed here will only be focused on one type of hardware :v. This project isn't
intended to be usable or used for something but if you like, you are welcome to use it.

So... what does the name means?
Well I didn't think a lot with the name, the first think that came to my mind was
"feeding with knowledge" because all of this comes to my curiosity about
_how does the operative systems works?_ and in the way to satisfy my curiosity I decided to do
this project. But for some reason I'd mention it to ChatGPT and give me the next meaning
"Flexible and Experimental Educational Operative System" and I like it more than my own
definition :).

# Building

On the first instance of this project, there will be some experiments to
how to build it, but I think that mostly of the steps will be on the [Build Guide](BUILD.md)

# Goals

First of all you must understand that this is a project that is intended to understand how an
operative system works, so most of the goals are going to be _how to do \<something\>?_,
_why does it should be [not] done like that?_, and
_understand a \<hardware, bus, communication, etc.\>_. So most of the list will be updated over
the time I discover more about operative systems and kernel.

- [ ] How to code on Bare Metal
- [ ] How to code a kernel
- [ ] Understand memory
- [ ] How to use communication buses
- [ ] How to map devices
- [ ] Know the types of devices
- [ ] Know how
- [ ] How to access to disk
- [ ] How does drivers works
- [ ] Write a first driver
- [ ] How to boot the kernel


# Contribute

If you'd like to make a contribution I'll be grateful with you, but even that there will be rules
to contribute to this, so I'd want you to read the [how to contribute](CONTRIBUTION.md) file.
